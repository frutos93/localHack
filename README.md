Local Hack Day Anti Harrassment Chrome Extension
## Inspiration
We wanted to create something to fight bullying. We both have been bullied at some point in our lives so we wanted to fight this. It is something that shouldn't be treated lightly.

## What it does
It substitutes every harrassment tweet made and changes it for chuck norris jokes and other kind of jokes

## How we built it
We used jquery, js, and ajax calls to call into the bark api.

## Challenges we ran into
We got a lot of errors corresponding the bark API, we didn't know how to address them but we took it calmly and solve them

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Pretty much all the project

## What we learned
How to make a chrome extension, how do they work and how to interact with bark API trough ajax calls.

## What's next for the application
Implement it for Facebook and other social networks
